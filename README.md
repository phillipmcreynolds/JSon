# JSon
A utility class for (de)serializing objects to/from JSON

Right now it has only one method, arrayToJSON, which will serialize an arbitary ArrayList of type Object to JSON, provided that the objects implement toString in a JSON conformant way.

No real error checking right now.

Might save someone a few minutes and help them avoid learning some bulky framework just to do this one thing.
